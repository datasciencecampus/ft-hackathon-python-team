# `Team FinTrans Wordle clone`

Welcome to the FinTrans python team Wordle.

To use, clone the repository in your local drive. We suggest cloning into a folder called git_repos and the instructions will be based on that.

## Getting started

To start using this project, [first make sure your system meets its
requirements](#requirements).

It's suggested that you install this pack and it's requirements within a virtual environment.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6.1+ installed
- Customtkinter
- CTkMessagebox
- Pillow

The required packages can be installed directly from the requirements.txt file. For the example directory below:
```
C:/
└── Users/
    └── YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME/
        └── git_repos/
            └── hackathon-python-team/
                └── requirements.txt
```
If your Anaconda Prompt window opens in the C drive, the command is:
```shell
pip install -r "Users/YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME/git_repos/hackathon-python-team/requirements.txt"
```
If it opens in another drive, you must move to the C drive first:

```shell
cd /d C:
pip install -r "Users/YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME/git_repos/hackathon-python-team/requirements.txt"
```
